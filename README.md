üåê EcoNexyz: Autonomous AI-agent ecosystem seamlessly bridging tasks and knowledge

üß† Conceptual Overview of EcoNexyz Repo
#### Main Idea:
EcoNexyz is an ecological system of autonomous AI agents that can be registered, communicate through a central message bus, store knowledge in a local/cloud-compatible repository, and visualize their activities on a dashboard‚Äîall wrapped behind minimal abstractions.

### Essential Components:

‚úÖ Message Bus (local or cloud, e.g., Redis or NATS, mocked via in-memory queue initially).

‚úÖ Knowledge Repository (local filesystem or cloud-compatible DB, mocked with SQLite initially).

‚úÖ Agent Registration & Autonomy (simple Python interface for agents, lifecycle hooks).

‚úÖ Dashboard/Visualization (minimal FastAPI backend + React/Next.js dashboard, initially simple API + minimal web front-end).

### Key Abstractions:
- `Agent`: Autonomous tasks encapsulated in Python classes with lifecycle (setup, run, shutdown).

- `MessageBus`: Pub/sub communication interface (send/receive).

- `KnowledgeStore`: Unified interface for storage/retrieval (key-value/document).

- `Dashboard` : API endpoints feeding real-time agent status.
