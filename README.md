# 🦾 EcoNexyz: Agent Development Guide (`AGENTS.md`)

Use GitHub issues for instructions. If you have an issue number, fetch its body with:

```bash
curl -sL https://api.github.com/repos/plva/econexyz/issues/<NUMBER>
```

For background on our tooling choices see [docs/adr/index.md](docs/adr/index.md). Any design decision affecting repository tooling must include a new ADR.

## Quickstart

Clone the repository and run the bootstrap script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/plva/econexyz
cd econexyz
./bootstrap.sh
```

Run a task inside the environment:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh test
```

The script creates `.venv` with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) and installs pre-commit hooks. Run `./bootstrap.sh --help` for usage details.
