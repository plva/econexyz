üåê EcoNexyz: Autonomous AI-agent ecosystem seamlessly bridging tasks and knowledge

üß† Conceptual Overview of EcoNexyz Repo
#### Main Idea:
EcoNexyz is an ecological system of autonomous AI agents that can be registered, communicate through a central message bus, store knowledge in a local/cloud-compatible repository, and visualize their activities on a dashboard‚Äîall wrapped behind minimal abstractions.

### Essential Components:

‚úÖ Message Bus (local or cloud, e.g., Redis or NATS, mocked via in-memory queue initially).

‚úÖ Knowledge Repository (local filesystem or cloud-compatible DB, mocked with SQLite initially).

‚úÖ Agent Registration & Autonomy (simple Python interface for agents, lifecycle hooks).

‚úÖ Dashboard/Visualization (minimal FastAPI backend + React/Next.js dashboard, initially simple API + minimal web front-end).

### Key Abstractions:
- `Agent`: Autonomous tasks encapsulated in Python classes with lifecycle (setup, run, shutdown).

- `MessageBus`: Pub/sub communication interface (send/receive).

- `KnowledgeStore`: Unified interface for storage/retrieval (key-value/document).

- `Dashboard` : API endpoints feeding real-time agent status.


## Repository Structure

- `econexyz/` ‚Äì core Python modules for agents (including a sample and weather agent), message bus, and storage.
- `dashboard/api/` ‚Äì FastAPI server exposing simple monitoring endpoints.
- `dashboard/web/` ‚Äì minimal React dashboard displaying status and messages.
- `scripts/` ‚Äì helper scripts to run agents and the dashboard.

## Quick Start

1. Bootstrap your environment and start the agents **and dashboard**:
   ```bash
   source bootstrap.sh
   ```
   This will create a virtual environment (if needed), install requirements, and launch the agents together with the FastAPI dashboard server.
2. Open `dashboard/web/index.html` in your browser to view agent status and messages.
   If you start the dashboard using `scripts/run_dashboard.sh` in a separate process,
   it won't display messages because the default in-memory bus isn't shared across
   processes.

Visit `http://localhost:8000/` for instructions, `http://localhost:8000/status` to see agent status and `http://localhost:8000/messages` for recent bus messages.

## bootstrap.sh: Environment Setup & Agent Runner

The `bootstrap.sh` script automates the following:
- Checks for Python 3 and required files
- Creates and activates a virtual environment (`.venv`)
- Installs all Python requirements
- Starts the agent runner script

**Usage:**
```bash
source bootstrap.sh
```

If any step fails, you'll see a clear error message. Always use `source` so your shell stays in the activated environment.

## Configuration

The repository includes a color palette definition at `config/color_palette.json`. These values are used by the dashboard for consistent styling.

Runtime logs are written to `~/tmp/econexyz.log` and are ignored by git. Agents log setup, shutdown, and message publishing events to help verify they are running correctly.

## Project TODOs

Ongoing development tasks are tracked in [TODO.md](TODO.md). Contributions and ideas are welcome!

## Sprint Workflow

Active sprints are defined in `sprints/current/` as markdown files listing the issues being tackled. When a sprint concludes, archive its file with:

```bash
./scripts/archive_sprint.sh <sprint-name>
```

The script moves the sprint file to `sprints/archive/` for future reference.

To view the sprint plan in JSON form for AI tools, run:

```bash
python scripts/ai_helper.py
```

To normalize sprint files and fix minor formatting issues, pass `--fix`:

```bash
python scripts/ai_helper.py --fix
```

### Transactional Git helper

Run commands atomically using `git_transaction.sh`:

```bash
./scripts/git_transaction.sh start "My commit message"
# ...make your changes...
./scripts/git_transaction.sh finalize
```

If something goes wrong, run `./scripts/git_transaction.sh rollback`
to restore the previous state. The helper stashes any pre-existing
changes, uses a temporary branch for your edits and squashes the
result into a single commit. See `scripts/transaction_example.py` for
a Python example. Untracked files are stashed automatically; use
`--all` with `git stash push` if you need to include ignored files.
