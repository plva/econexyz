# 0007 – Contributor Experience Kit

*Status*: **Accepted**

## Context

External contributors—including AI agents—benefit from clear templates and rules of engagement.

## Decision

* `CONTRIBUTING.md` – setup, lint, test, commit flow.
* Issue templates: bug, feature, question.
* PR template with checklist.
* Contributor Covenant 2.1 as `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

## Alternatives Considered

* **No templates** – fastest now, but yields low-quality issues.
* **Third-party bots for templates** – additional infra, latency.

## Consequences

* Higher-quality issues/PRs.
* Slight repo noise; acceptable trade-off.
