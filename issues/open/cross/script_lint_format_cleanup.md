# cross/script_lint_format_cleanup

Review all scripts in the `scripts/` directory for:
- Consistent use of docstrings and comments
- Linting and formatting (e.g., shellcheck for bash, black/flake8 for Python)
- Removal of any unused code or variables

This ensures maintainability and clarity across all automation and helper scripts.
