# workflow/manage_language_model_keys

Determine how API keys for language model services should be stored and shared
with new collaborators or agents. Consider security best practices and ease of
setup.

- Evaluate using environment variables versus encrypted config files.
- Provide onboarding documentation for adding keys during setup.
- Explore tools like `direnv` or secret managers for local development.
