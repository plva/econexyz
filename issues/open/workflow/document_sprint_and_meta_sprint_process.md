# workflow/document_sprint_and_meta_sprint_process

Document the sprint and meta-sprint process, including:
- How to plan, run, and close sprints
- How to use scripts for sprint management (e.g., archiving, moving issues)
- How to handle meta-sprints and their relationship to regular sprints
- Where to find workflow diagrams and how to interpret them

This should be included in the documentation and referenced in onboarding materials.
