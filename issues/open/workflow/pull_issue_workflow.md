# Pull-Issue Workflow

## Summary

Create a comprehensive workflow for pulling issues from the current sprint, working on them through completion, and ensuring proper testing, documentation, and commit practices. This workflow should automate the development cycle from issue selection to completion.

## Implementation Plan

### Stage 1: Issue Selection and Decision Process
- [ ] **Create issue selection script** (`scripts/pull_issue.py`)
  - [ ] Parse current sprint from `state/sprint.json`
  - [ ] Read sprint meta file to get available issues
  - [ ] Filter for open issues (not marked with `[x]`)
  - [ ] Display issues with metadata (priority, tags, description)
  - [ ] Implement decision criteria:
    - Priority level (high/medium/low)
    - Issue type (bug vs feature vs workflow)
    - Estimated complexity
    - Dependencies and blockers
    - Time available for work session
- [ ] **Add interactive selection mode**
  - [ ] Show numbered list of available issues
  - [ ] Allow user to select by number or name
  - [ ] Provide "random" selection option for quick starts
  - [ ] Show issue details before confirmation
  - [ ] Allow backing out and re-selecting

### Stage 2: Issue Preparation and Setup
- [ ] **Create issue preparation script**
  - [ ] Mark selected issue as "in progress" in sprint meta
  - [ ] Create working branch: `issue/<category>/<issue-name>`
  - [ ] Update issue status to "in-progress"
  - [ ] Add timestamp for work start
  - [ ] Create work session log file
- [ ] **Environment validation**
  - [ ] Check git status (clean working tree)
  - [ ] Verify tests are passing before starting
  - [ ] Check for any uncommitted changes
  - [ ] Ensure virtual environment is activated

### Stage 3: Development Workflow
- [ ] **Create development helper script**
  - [ ] Track time spent on issue
  - [ ] Provide quick access to issue details
  - [ ] Show related files and documentation
  - [ ] Integrate with existing scripts (create_issue, etc.)
- [ ] **Work session management**
  - [ ] Start/stop work session tracking
  - [ ] Log progress and decisions made
  - [ ] Capture any blockers or questions
  - [ ] Auto-save work session notes

### Stage 4: Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Automated testing integration**
  - [ ] Run test suite before and after changes
  - [ ] Check for linting issues
  - [ ] Verify git hooks still work
  - [ ] Run specific tests related to the issue
- [ ] **Quality gates**
  - [ ] Ensure all tests pass
  - [ ] Check for any new warnings
  - [ ] Verify documentation is updated
  - [ ] Confirm no breaking changes

### Stage 5: Documentation Updates
- [ ] **Documentation checklist**
  - [ ] Update relevant README files
  - [ ] Add usage examples if new functionality
  - [ ] Update workflow documentation if needed
  - [ ] Check for API documentation updates
  - [ ] Verify commit message templates are current
- [ ] **Documentation validation**
  - [ ] Check for broken links
  - [ ] Verify examples work
  - [ ] Ensure consistency with existing docs

### Stage 6: Commit and Completion
- [ ] **Commit message generation**
  - [ ] Auto-generate commit message from issue details
  - [ ] Include work session summary
  - [ ] Add appropriate commit type and tags
  - [ ] Validate commit message format
- [ ] **Issue completion workflow**
  - [ ] Close the issue using `close_issue.sh`
  - [ ] Update TODO.md (mark as completed)
  - [ ] Update sprint meta (mark as done)
  - [ ] Create completion summary
  - [ ] Archive work session notes

### Stage 7: Integration and Cleanup
- [ ] **Post-completion tasks**
  - [ ] Merge branch to main
  - [ ] Clean up temporary files
  - [ ] Update any related issues
  - [ ] Check for follow-up tasks
- [ ] **Workflow optimization**
  - [ ] Analyze time spent vs estimated
  - [ ] Identify any process improvements
  - [ ] Update workflow documentation
  - [ ] Share learnings with team

## Scripts to Create

### Primary Scripts
1. `scripts/pull_issue.py` - Main workflow orchestrator
2. `scripts/issue_selector.py` - Issue selection and decision logic
3. `scripts/work_session.py` - Work session management
4. `scripts/issue_completer.py` - Completion and cleanup

### Helper Scripts
1. `scripts/validate_environment.py` - Pre-work validation
2. `scripts/generate_commit.py` - Commit message generation
3. `scripts/update_documentation.py` - Documentation updates

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Pull an issue to work on
python scripts/pull_issue.py

# Pull specific issue
python scripts/pull_issue.py --issue workflow/example_issue

# Pull random issue
python scripts/pull_issue.py --random

# Complete current issue
python scripts/pull_issue.py --complete
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Pull issue with specific criteria
python scripts/pull_issue.py --priority high --type bug

# Work session management
python scripts/work_session.py --start
python scripts/work_session.py --stop
python scripts/work_session.py --log "Made progress on feature X"

# Quick completion
python scripts/pull_issue.py --quick-complete
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Single command can pull an issue from current sprint
- [ ] Decision process helps select appropriate issues
- [ ] Work session is properly tracked and logged
- [ ] All quality gates are automated and enforced
- [ ] Documentation updates are prompted and validated
- [ ] Commit messages are properly formatted and descriptive
- [ ] Issue completion is fully automated
- [ ] Workflow integrates with existing scripts
- [ ] Process is well-documented with examples
- [ ] Error handling and rollback capabilities exist

- Sprint state management: `state/sprint.json`
- Issue tracking: `TODO.md`, sprint meta files
- Git workflow: branch management, commit hooks

## Success Metrics
