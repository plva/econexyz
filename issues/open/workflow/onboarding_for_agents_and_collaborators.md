# workflow/onboarding_for_agents_and_collaborators

Create or improve onboarding documentation for new agents and collaborators, including:
- Overview of the repository structure
- How to register and implement new agents
- How to contribute to the dashboard, message bus, or storage
- Coding standards and best practices
- Where to find help and documentation

This should be included in a dedicated onboarding section in the documentation.
