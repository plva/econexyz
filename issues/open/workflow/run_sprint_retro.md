# workflow/run_sprint_retro

Outline the steps for conducting a sprint retrospective to identify improvements for future iterations.

## Proposed Agenda

- Review sprint goals from `sprints/current/sprint-meta.md`.
- Collect anonymous feedback via a simple survey tool (`docs/surveys/sprint_retro.md`).
- The survey tool is optional; record this idea in a backburner issue for later.
- Discuss what went well, what didn't, and actionable improvements.
- Investigate whether an agent can summarize logs to aid this discussion.
- Capture agreed action items in `sprints/current/retro.md` for follow-up.
- Clarify whether retros for past sprints should be archived separately; track in
  a backburner note.
- Use a facilitator to ensure all voices are heard and the meeting stays on track.
- Consider time-boxing topics to keep the retro under one hour.
