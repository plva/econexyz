# workflow/automate_todo_sprint_migration

Automate the migration of tasks between the top-level TODO.md and sprint TODO files, including:
- Moving tasks into the current sprint when planned
- Removing or archiving completed tasks
- Keeping TODO.md and sprint files in sync
- Providing a CLI or script for maintainers to use

This will reduce manual effort and ensure consistency across planning documents.
