# workflow/agent_smart_issue_creator

Design an advanced agent that can generate new issues from a short task
description. Features should include:

- Searching the repository, open issues, and sprint metadata for
  relevant context.
- Suggesting appropriate categories and tags automatically.
- Expanding the description with implementation ideas or follow-up
  subtasks.
- Allowing a human reviewer to approve or modify the generated issue
  before it is committed.

This agent may require multiple iterations and could depend on a larger
language model or external services.
