# Implement bug fix workflow and issue reopening

## Summary

Implement functionality to handle bug reports and reopen closed issues when bugs reappear. This includes adding a bug template, updating the issue workflow, and modifying scripts to support bug fix tracking.

## Implementation Plan

1. Add bug category and template:
   - [x] Add "bugs" category to `config/issue_categories.yml`
   - [x] Create `docs/templates/bug_template.md`
   - [x] Update issue workflow documentation

2. Enhance issue creation script:
   - [x] Modify `create_issue.py` to support reopening closed issues
   - [x] Add `--reopen` flag to specify issue to reopen
   - [x] Add `--template` flag to specify template to use (default/bug)
   - [x] Update script to copy issue content when reopening

3. Update issue tracking:
   - [x] Add bug status tracking in sprint metadata (handled by existing close_issue.sh)
   - [x] Add bug priority levels (critical/high/medium/low) - supported by script
   - [x] Track regression bugs separately (via reopen functionality)

4. Documentation updates:
   - [x] Add bug reporting guide (`docs/guides/bug_reporting.md`)
   - [x] Update development process docs (`docs/guides/development.md`)
   - [x] Add examples of bug reporting (included in guides)

## Additional Context

This implementation will help track bugs more effectively and prevent regressions by making it easier to reference and reopen past issues when bugs reappear.

## Usage Examples

### Create a new bug issue:
```bash
python scripts/create_issue.py bugs dashboard_not_loading --template bug --priority high
```

### Reopen a closed bug:
```bash
python scripts/create_issue.py --reopen bugs/dashboard_not_loading --template bug
```

### Create a bug with custom tags:
```bash
python scripts/create_issue.py bugs test_failure --template bug --priority medium --tags "test,regression"
```

## Status: COMPLETE âœ…

All planned functionality has been implemented and documented. The bug workflow is now fully functional and ready for use.
