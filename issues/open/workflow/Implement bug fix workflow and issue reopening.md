# Implement bug fix workflow and issue reopening

## Summary

Implement functionality to handle bug reports and reopen closed issues when bugs reappear. This includes adding a bug template, updating the issue workflow, and modifying scripts to support bug fix tracking.

## Implementation Plan

1. Add bug category and template:
   - [x] Add "bugs" category to `config/issue_categories.yml`
   - [x] Create `docs/templates/bug_template.md`
   - [x] Update issue workflow documentation

2. Enhance issue creation script:
   - [ ] Modify `create_issue.py` to support reopening closed issues
   - [ ] Add `--reopen` flag to specify issue to reopen
   - [ ] Add `--template` flag to specify template to use (default/bug)
   - [ ] Update script to copy issue content when reopening

3. Update issue tracking:
   - [ ] Add bug status tracking in sprint metadata
   - [ ] Add bug priority levels (critical/high/medium/low)
   - [ ] Track regression bugs separately

4. Documentation updates:
   - [ ] Add bug reporting guide
   - [ ] Update development process docs
   - [ ] Add examples of bug reporting

## Additional Context

This implementation will help track bugs more effectively and prevent regressions by making it easier to reference and reopen past issues when bugs reappear.
