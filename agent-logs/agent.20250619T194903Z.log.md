Addressed review comments on workflow issue files and added clarifications or
follow-up tasks. Created a backburner directory for brainstorming ideas and new
workflow issues for managing language model keys and running tests on PRs.

## Updated Files

- Edited all workflow issue descriptions to incorporate feedback.
- Added `issues/backburner/workflow/brainstorming.md` for cross-cutting ideas.
- Created two new open issues: `manage_language_model_keys.md` and
  `run_tests_on_pr.md`.
