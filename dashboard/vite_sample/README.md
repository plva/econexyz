# Vite Sample

This directory contains a small React project built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
It serves as a minimal example before migrating the main dashboard.

## Usage

Install dependencies and build:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The compiled output will be placed in `dist/`.
`bootstrap.sh` performs these steps automatically when setting up the project.
